# Sound Quiz

This simple app contains multiple quizzes on different categories. Your task in each quiz is listen to short snippet of a song and choose the most suitable answer. To succeed in quizzes, you have to demonstrate your musical overview and/or knowledge of music history. 

You need to use your headphones (or audio speakers) to complete the quizzes!
