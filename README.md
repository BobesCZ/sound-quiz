# Sound Quiz

This simple app contains multiple quizzes on different topics. Your task in each quiz is to listen to a short snippet of a song and choose the most suitable answer. To succeed in the quizzes, you have to demonstrate your musical overview and/or knowledge of music history. 

You need to use your headphones (or audio speakers) to complete the quizzes!

You can use it online at [music.g6.cz](http://music.g6.cz/).
